# RouteScope Monorepo Scaffold

1. Re-read `dev/PRD_RouteScope_v2.0.md` and `dev/TDD_RouteScope_v2.0.md` before scaffolding.
2. Create only the baseline structure required by the current milestone:
- `packages/shared-schema`
- `packages/analyzer-core`
- `packages/extension`
- `packages/webview-app`
- `fixtures/`
3. Keep npm as the only package manager in scripts, docs, and commands.
4. Set strict TypeScript and shared base config early (`tsconfig.base.json`).
5. Keep package responsibilities isolated; do not let analyzer depend on VSCode APIs.

## Scaffold Checklist

- Root `package.json` with npm workspaces and shared scripts
- `package-lock.json` tracked
- Workspace package names with stable scope (for example `@routescope/*`)
- Build/test/typecheck scripts at root and package level
- Minimal README-free scaffolding in skills context (no extra docs generated by default)

## Guardrails

- Do not over-generate files outside current implementation phase.
- Do not introduce `pnpm`/`yarn`/`bun` commands.
- Preserve extension-first architecture from PRD/TDD.
